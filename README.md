## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
 Titanic is one of the most famous tragedies in modern history,the Royal Mail Ship Titanic sank on april 14-15, 1912. The tragedy left many passangers dead and the numbers are not accurately known to date. This is where machine learning comes into play. Machine learning helps us to predict if a passenger survived / not by using all the necessary features in our dataset. Some of the algorithms to put into cosideration are Random forest and K-nearest neighbors.

 Spambase is whre we try to identify if a mail is spam or ham. Spam are irrelevant messages sent over the Internet, typically to a large number of users, for the purposes of advertising.
 Machine learningalgorithmns such as Deep Learning, Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, etc, can be used to identify whether an email is spam or not. In this case we are going to implement naive bayes algorithm to see how well it can predict if a mail is spam or not. Naive bayes takes less take in execution and likely to make the correct predictions.
